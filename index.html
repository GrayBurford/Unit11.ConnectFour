<!-- Step One: Planning
- Grid for gameboard. 6 Rows & 7 columns that are playable. 1 row of 7 dotted squares above to add event listeners to. Use set dimensions for the height and width.
- How to represent a played-piece in the HTML board? Increment a counter by 1 everytime one of the squares is clicked. If the counter is even, it's p1's turn and drops red circle. If the counter is odd -- or 2 -- it's p2's turn and drops a blue circle. Variable called player set to 1, then changes to 0 or 2 for player 2. Or a variable called let p1 = true, and set to false if it is not p1's turn.
- Structure of in-memory game board: Use x and y coordinates of the grid/gameboard and check if there are 3 others in a row that are the same color.
- Gameflow: Start as p1. currPlayer = 1? Or a counter variable starts at 0. Add event listeners to the top squares making only those squares "playable." When one of those squares is clicked, a red/blue circle appears at the bottom of that column. That circle/div has a class set to a color for p1 or p2's piece. The counter increments by 1. The counter being odd or even determines whose turn it is.
- Function names/descriptions: makeBoard(), handleClick(), dropPiece(), checkForWinner(),  -->
